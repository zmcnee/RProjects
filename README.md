The following projects are examples of data cleaning from csv's containing different formatting with the goal of getting easy-to-consume outputs on KPI's. Dates and totals have been adjusted and do not reflect real world outcomes. 

Attached is the code used as a .txt, the cleaned and combined data frame as a .csv, and the resulting outputs as a pdf.
