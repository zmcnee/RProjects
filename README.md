The following projects are examples of data cleaning from csv's containing different formatting with the goal of getting easy-to-consume outputs on KPI's. Dates and totals have been adjusted and do not reflect real world outcomes. 

Attached is the code used as a .txt, the cleaned and combined data frame as a .csv, and the resulting outputs as a pdf. 

One point of analysis is for the Billing Department. It is clear to see that call volume and service level both are taking hits Monday - Wednesday in the last two weeks of the month. This would indicate calls are still coming in, but they are not being answered. This could be due to call outs, low staffing, or a strong case of the Monday (Tuesday and Wednesday) Blues. 


Cheers :)
